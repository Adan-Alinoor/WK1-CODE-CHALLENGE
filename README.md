## WEEK 1 CODE CHALLENGE

## 23/3/2024

### BY ADAN ALINOOR MOHAMED

## DESCRIPTION
The project consists of three separate challenges, each involving writing a program to solve a specific task:

 1.**Student Grade Generator** : This program prompts the user to input student marks, which should be between 0 and 100. Based on the input marks, the program determines and outputs the corresponding grade, following these criteria: A for marks greater than 79, B for marks between 60 and 79, C for marks between 49 and 59, D for marks between 40 and 49, and E for marks less than 40.

 2.**Speed Detector**: The program takes as input the speed of a car and evaluates if it exceeds the speed limit. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit, it assigns one demerit point to the driver and prints the total number of demerit points. If the total demerit points exceed 12, the program prints "License suspended".

3.**Net Salary Calculato**r: This program calculates an individual's net salary based on inputs such as basic salary and benefits. It calculates deductions for PAYE (Tax), NHIF, and NSSF according to predefined rates provided through external links. The program computes gross salary, deductions, and net salary based on these inputs and rates.
